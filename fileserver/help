HELP

The purpose of the webpage grabber is to allow users who only have
e-mail access to the internet to retreive resources from the internet.
This is acheived by an automatic response robot which parses e-mail
messages and sends back the requested documents. This program has the
ability to:

	1. Search the internet 
	2. Retreive web pages 
	3. Send locally stored files 


To get an index of all the files available send a message to
webpage@rumkin.com and in the subject put: send index

To request a web page that is converted to text:
To: webpage@rumkin.com
Subject: url <ADDRESS>

To request the HTML source of a web page:
To: webpage@rumkin.com
Subject: source <ADDRESS>

To ask for a web page and all of the associated images, etc. (up to 1Mb)
in one zip file:
To: webpage@rumkin.com
Subject: webpage <ADDRESS>

To search the internet with Google (returns 50 matches):
To: webpage@rumkin.com
Subject: search <KEYWORDS>

Replace keywords with your search terms with spaces converted to +'s
(ie. "high school" --> high+school).


You can not download binary files directly with the webpage grabber.  So,
don't try to download MP3 files or Zip file archives.  Also, the "webpage"
command is limited to 1Mb to prevent abuse.


If you want to get the web page in your email so that you can view it, see
the images, and maybe click the links, you are out of luck.  This web page
grabber can not do that.  The closest thing is the "webpage" command, which
will grab up to 1Mb of stuff and zip it all up for you.

There are other services out there that do a similar task.  One list has not
been updated since 2003, but shows several servers:

Also, you could check out http://vancouver-webpages.com/webgate/ for
information on Webgate (a similar type of server).
