To all,

I've just developed a thing that some of you might be interested in.

The 5 lines of garbled text at the end of this msg is in fact an MSDOS
executable UUDECODE header. Just prepend it to a UUENCODE 
text file, starting at the '%!!...' and rename the file with a .COM 
extension.

USAGE
If this executable text cluster is inserted into a mail message before the
UUENCODE data, it's possible to give the user instructions on how
to use a word processor to extract the executable+uue_data to form a
self-extracting .COM file.

FEATURES
The executable text cluster is only 400 bytes long. It is immune to CR/LF
mangling that often happens between internet and MSDOS machines.
This text cluster contains no space characters, so that word processors
will not try to wrap the lines.

TECHNICAL 
The first line MUST NOT be broken; it's the level 1
boot loader. It is real 8086 code, using only 0x21-0x7E.

The other lines must contain an even number. This is the level
2 loader. This section can tolerate CR <-> CR/LF mangling. This
section contains encoded machine code, with each byte of machine
code represented by 2 bytes of ASCII.

This UUDECODEr handles 'begin'-'end' sequences only, one file
per decode. The output filename MUST be included in the UUENCODEd
data, as the third field on the 'begin' line. The .COM file must
be executed in the same directory where you want the output file.

REQUEST
I have take this to the point that it's working. If anyone is
interested in adding some 'polish' to it, the source code is 
available.

If this project is of interest, either for your use, or
for enhancement, please contact me.
